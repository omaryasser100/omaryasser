# Omar Yasser

Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer focused on building intelligent, explainable, and deployable AI systems.  
My work spans end-to-end development: from exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to model training, optimization, and deployment through Streamlit and Hugging Face Spaces.

I enjoy turning data into insight, insight into models, and models into real-world applications.

### 2. Arabic Chatbot and Fine-Tuning Trials
**Repo:** [Arabic Chatbot](https://github.com/omaryasser100/Arabic_chatbot)  
**Hugging Face Space:** [Link to Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-space-name)  

An experimental project focused on Arabic language understanding and response generation.  
Fine-tuned **Qwen** and other LLMs on a small custom Arabic dataset for both classification and chat response generation.  
Explores tokenizer handling, model adaptation, and instruction-based fine-tuning using the **Unsloth** framework.

### 3. Chat with YouTube Videos
**Repo:** [Chat with YouTube](https://github.com/omaryasser100/chat_with_youtube)  

A retrieval-augmented question-answering system built using **LangChain**, **OpenAI GPT models**, and **YouTube Transcript API**.  
Fetches video transcripts, retrieves context, and allows users to ask natural language questions about any YouTube video.  
Deployed via **Gradio interface** for quick interaction.
